# Neighbour API
This is an API for neighbourhood collaboration site and we want to keep track of people, houses, and addresses of those houses. 
We have collected the following details:
   - Each person has a name, age and number of people in their household
   - Each house has an address and an owner
   - Each address has a postcode and street address

Users are able to:
   - Store people, houses and addresses
   - Look up a house, itâ€™s address and owner
   - Look up people in our neighbourhood within certain age brackets and with specific household sizes
